## Notes

BlazorWASM allows for PWA Apps out of the box, also makes a Client/Server Model.

BlazorServer seems to be similar to BlazorWASM, but only provides the server (No client/PWA).

ReactRedux does not support ASP.NET Core 6.0 at the moment.

ASPX is only ASP.NET Framework.

Core with Angular and React Redux utilize TypeScript.

Core with React Redux utilizes TSX files, which is a TypeScript ( .TS) file written using JSX syntax.

## Todo

Test Rider support.

Test Libraries (Newtonsoft.Json, MongoDB.Driver, etc..)
